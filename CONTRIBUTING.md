### Welcome

We welcome contributions to the Fr8r-Proxy Project in many forms, and there's always plenty to do!

First things first, please review the Fr8r-Proxy Project's [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) before participating. It is important that we keep things civil.

### Getting help
If you are looking for something to work on, or need some expert assistance in debugging a problem or working out a fix to an issue, our community is always eager to help. We hang out on \[TODO] [Slack](https://fr8r.slack.com/), IRC (#fr8r on freenode.net) and the [mailing lists](http://example.com/). \[TODO] create mailing list

### Reporting bugs
If you are a user and you find a bug, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/issues). Please try to provide sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the issue. One of the project's maintainers should respond to your issue within 24 hours. If not, please bump the issue and request that it be reviewed.

### Fixing issues and working stories
Review the [issues list](https://github.com/fr8r/fr8r-proxy/issues) and find something that interests you. You could also check the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/fr8r/fr8r-proxy/labels/help%20wanted) list. It is wise to start with something relatively straight forward and achievable. Usually there will be a comment in the issue that indicates whether someone has already self-assigned the issue. If no one has already taken it, then add a comment assigning the issue to yourself, eg.: ```I'll work on this issue.```. Please be considerate and rescind the offer in comments if you cannot finish in a reasonable time, or add a comment saying that you are still actively working the issue if you need a little more time.

We are using the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) process to manage code contributions. If you are unfamiliar, please review that link before proceeding.
